            <h1>Diego Guevara</h1>
            <p>I'm a former electromechanical engineer with a deep passion for both renewable energy and programming. I'm currently transitioning into the tech industry, eager to apply my skills as a full-stack developer. I've trained through the freeCodeCamp bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development. I'm incredibly grateful to the freeCodeCamp team — their lessons empowered me to build this very website. Right now, I'm actively seeking my first opportunity in tech, where I can grow professionally, contribute to meaningful projects, and learn from experienced teammates. My long-term goal? To reach a point where I can combine my engineering background with my coding expertise to support innovative green solutions within a forward-thinking IT team. A phrase that I really like to quote? "If you ever find yourself waiting for a bus that seems like it’ll never come, you have two options: keep waiting, or take different buses until you reach the same destination. It might take longer, but you'll get to where you desire. However, if you hesitate for a third option, you might watch your bus leave just after you’ve stepped away from the station"</p>
